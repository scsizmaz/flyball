## Some words about the Flyball:

Flyball emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s in California. Two teams compete against each other with 4-4 dogs. 
The dogs each run in relays on a parallel track for the ball, which is waiting for them at the end of a 15-16 metre 
track in a launching structure. If they touch it with their paws, it releases the tennis ball so the dog can catch it.
 They also have to jump over four obstacles while running on the track, without knocking them down, of course. 
 They must get the ball back to where they started in as little time as possible. The next dog can start its own round
 after the previous one has crossed the start/finish line.

## Summary:

This analysis is based on a fictional data, but with real background and situation.

The coach of a fictitious Flyball* team (Wild Runners Flyball Team - shortly WRFT) contacted the 
Data Science Club to help him process his team's 2023 tournament results. 

The analysis was made for the in-house competition of the [Data36.com](https://data36.com)
and the [dataklub.hu](https://dataklub.hu) 
Data Science Club, where I was rewarded with a Special Prize for the in-house Data36 Data Science Club Competition.

## 1) Project Objective

The goal is to help the team perform better in the future.

The initial datasets contain the results of the Czech national and the international competition related to the 
WRFT team for year 2023,  furthermore the base data of the racing dogs. 
The datasets are available [here](https://github.com/scsizmaz/flyball/tree/main/data/source).
